    "2. Narrative/creative writing: the human texts comprised original Reddit posts in the r/relationship_advice and r/AITA subreddits, which consisted of a mixture of presumably real life stories and fantasy, and the AI texts comprised responses from the GPT-3.5 Turbo API upon prompting to write Reddit posts with the same titles.<br>The prompts used were:<br>\n",

At times it is clear how most of the 'doctors' are charlatans, even lying about how they don't charge their clients. While they are wearing their gold watches, the 'donation' box is mandatory. Notice that there are only a couple of people who get 'cured' while we see quite a few cases.<br /><br />Keep in mind while watching that ingesting mercury is not toxic and that the smallest Indian bank note is 5 rupee, while the average salary in India is 1,700 ru/month.\n",

Forget the predictable Keanu-fodder of SPEED, forget the predictable Kleenex-fodder of WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING - this tests her!<br /><br />And she is great! A techno-feminist role that really works well on screen, on a subject that is very close to the bone. The issues raised don't seem far-fetched at all and the whole experience, helped along by a fine supporting cast, makes for quite an un-nerving couple of hours.<br /><br />You may never enter another chat-room again, in fact I'm getting quite nervous just writing this review...er...bye!\n",

      "First, let's call this movie what it is:<br /><br />1. It's a feel-good movie with a message.<br /><br />2. The acting is just okay, dialog slightly better, production value pretty good.<br /><br />3. Rugby scenes...just barely passable.<br /><br />But here's the trick: this isn't something Hollywood contrived, and it isn't trying to be a ferociously accurate portrayal of the sport. It is instead a pretty good representation of mostly real people, in real circumstances, and a real storyline. Sure, they could have done a better job actually rep'ing the sport, but my vote: it does a pretty good job at what it sets out to do.<br /><br />(And fwiw, I can't think of many football, baseball, hockey or soccer movies that are true to the sport either. C'mon...Bull Durham?)<br /><br />I'm not a rugby player (I was a wrestler) but I graduated from Highland, attended '86-'90, and occasionally trained with the Rugby guys. My brother-in-law David, however, was one of the original founding members of the Highland Rugby Club in 1976. (His younger brother, Billy, played the next year, as I recall. If you're interested, there's a Highland Rugby site at highlandrugby.net that addresses the history of the team.) <br /><br />By the time I was there the club had been in existence for about a decade, and had long since built a reputation for excellence. It's a fact that they focused on \"broad\" training topics: devotion, honor, discipline, effort, not tactics. I thought the rugby guys I knew were a little 'off' in the head, but I think I might have just been a little jealous. They were hard-core dedicated to the belief system that Gelwix promoted.<br /><br />With regard to the \"cultural mixing\" issues that have been brought up, it might be interesting to note that while I was there in the 80's, one of the larger schools in the city was shut down - South High School - and its students distributed among the other 3 primary SLC schools. To be honest, Highland pre-80's was pretty whitebread...I've got a picture of the team from (I think) 1977 that shows an *all* white club. South High, on the other hand, was a much more racially integrated school before it closed: I had a pair of friends from South who joined the team, one Tongan, one Samoan, and as I recall there were a bunch of Island-nation players that joined up '88-'90. I don't think anyone questioned the credibility of the team in adopting Maori (or other cultural) traditions: if there was one thing that was obvious about these guys, it's that they walked the walk. <br /><br />And as to the strength of the team when compared to the best highschool-age teams in the world: yeah, it's true that US-Rugby, on average when taken as a whole, does not represent particularly well against the best elsewhere. There are exceptions, but hey - it's a simple fact that Rugby doesn't have the prominence or exposure needed to develop the multiple traditions of excellence in the US that arise in other countries.<br /><br />With that said, judge Highland on its merits: <br /><br />- the *only* team to qualify for the USA Rugby National Championships every year of that organizations' 25-yr history.<br /><br />- a win record of 392 wins, 9 losses. Read that again...winningest coach in any US sport in history.<br /><br />- regular international tours. <br /><br />- some compelling wins against some legitimate international teams.<br /><br />Are they the world best? Maybe some years, probably not most...but they're pretty good on a consistent basis. And it's disrespectful to the game to blow them off, when Highland Rugby may be the best ambassador to the sport in the US.\n",

      "i know technically this isn't the greatest TV show ever,i mean it was shot on video and its limitations show in both the audio and visual aspect of it.the acting can at time be also a little crumby.but,i love this show so much.it scared the hell out of me when it first aired in 1988.of course it would i was 5 years old.but i recently purchased the DVD of the first 3 episodes,which unfortunately i hear is now deleted.and i also heard warner's aren't going to release any more due to the first DVD's bad sales.also the TV show didn't have the same feel as the movies,in fact i thought it had a more sinister tone.even though the colour palette is similar to nightmare on elm street 4(both that film and the TV show were made the same year),this has more of a serious tone whereas the fims were progressively getting more and more sardonic and jokey.not a bad thing,i like freddy as the clown wise cracker.but i think that was the strenght of this TV show,you didn't have freddy popping up every minutes cracking a joke before and after he kills somebody.in fact this has more of a dream feel to it,reinforced by the soft focus of the lense.im not sure if its deliberate on the part of the shows creators or just to the limitations of being shot on video. i love this show,and taken not as a companion piece to the movies can be very enjoyable.much better than anything on TV today.\n",

      "I just bought the DVD and i must say, (after seeing Brazil and Fear an loathing in Las Vegas) Terry does it again. As well of being a fan of the Monty Python movies, Terry Gilliam's genius follows through in this sci fi thriller, whom Bruce Willis plays a wonderful role as James Cole, and as well (perhaps my favorite character) Brad Pitt who played the insanity of Jefferey Goines. A must have for sci fi fans, or movie fan of any type really, because it includes suspense, drama, action, etc. <br /><br />any way the plot, In the future, 1% of the world's population survives a disease intended to wipe out the human race, which is unleashed in the past by \"the army of twelve monkeys\". James Cole( Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1996 (which is when the virus was unleashed) to find out about the disease, so scientists in his time can find a cure. Before i go further, James Cole lives in an underground society, and the animals rule the world on the surface due to the disease that will kill the humans. anyway when he is sent back in time he is actually sent back to 1990 where he is sent to a mental institution because of his tellings to people of the virus. During his stay he meets Jefferey Goins( Brad Pitt) who is later mostly responsible for wiping out the human race. He also meets his psychiatrist ((Madelein Stowe) who eventually teams up with Bruce to save the world ( as she sees that he is correct in his tellings), he is sent back and forth from his time to the past and eventually sent to 1996 where he then questions his own sanity but later pulls through to reveal a suspenseful end quarter of the movie and later builds up to the somewhat shocking climax, where he tries to stop the man carrying the virus( not actually Brad Pitt) and is instead shot by the police as the killer gets away.\n",

      "I went to see this movie (actually I went to see Family Portraits, which contains Cutting Moments + 2 other short films by Douglas Buck) at the Mar del Plata festival (Argentina)... I just couldn't watch it! I had to cover my eyes after the 1st half of Cutting Moments and take a peek every once in a while. By the time it was over, my stomach was upside down and I felt light headed. I just HAD to leave the cinema a few minutes after the 2nd short begun (BTW, of course I was not the only one who left the room). It was WAAAAY too violent and disgusting for me! I am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved it. I just don't get how you can love that kind of movies! The shocking and bloody and horrible images I saw got really stuck in my head for like two days!! I also try to analyze the story (my boyfriend did see the whole thing and told me about it) and I just don't think it makes any sense. I mean, that amount of violence and stuff, makes no other sense than to try to shock people. And that's not a good enough reason, I think. There's absolutely nothing in this movie that I can say \"Well, at least 'x' thing about it was good\". But well, I guess I will never understand that kind of films.\n",

      "Even if you're a fan of Jean Rollin's idiosyncratic body of work, you will be caught off guard by this exceptional foray into science fiction territory. For once, there's not a single diaphanously gowned vampire girl in sight ! True to tradition, the budget proved way too tight to realize the director's vision entirely. Yet this is largely compensated by his obvious love of genre cinema, dedication to his craft and sheer ingenuity. Jean-Claude Couty's atmospheric cinematography makes the most of the foreboding locations and Philippe Bréjean (a/k/a \"Gary Sandeur\") contributes a startling soundtrack that fortunately doesn't resemble any of the sappy stuff he composed for hardcore.<br /><br />Shot in and around a Paris office block before and after working hours, the film was largely cast with porn regulars Rollin was already quite familiar with from his \"Michel Gentil\" cash-gathering XXX efforts, most notably French f*ck film royalty Brigitte Lahaie in the demanding lead. Playing Elisabeth (rather well, I might add), she's picked up wandering a nearby highway one night by Robert (Vincent Gardère), driving home at the end of a long work day. Barely able to piece together the string of events that got her there, Elisabeth seems to lose her memories mere moments after events occur, even forgetting Robert's name and heroic savior role before their night flight comes to an end at his apartment. Prior to making love, she rightfully describes herself as a virgin (further credit to Brigitte's thespian skills that she can handle the line so convincingly, being after all one of the more active adult actresses of the '70s) because she cannot recall a single touch preceding his. Because of this nifty bit of context, the relatively long sex scene that follows totally eschews the gratuity of other \"commercial\" interludes Rollin has had to include in other works to assure funding.<br /><br />When Robert leaves for work, he's inevitably erased from Elisabeth's feeble mind. A mysterious doctor (comedian Bernard Papineau effectively cast against type) and his menacing assistant Solange (striking porn starlet Rachel Mhas) move in on her during her protector's absence and take her back to the place she turns out to have escaped from. Here we get one of the movie's strongest scenes as she's re-introduced to her roommate Catherine (the late Cathérine Greiner a/k/a hardcore performer \"Cathy Stewart\" in a quietly devastating turn), both girls desperately supplying fictitious shared \"memories\" for one another in a bid to outrun their inevitable fate. That deterioration is not solely limited to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and Catherine's unable to control her movements in trying to eat a spoonful of soup. It's also Catherine who gets to voice the filmmaker's compromise with the demands of commerce as she urges Elisabeth to get naked and hold her because sex is all they have left now that both mind and physical faculties have deserted them.<br /><br />Several rather explicit - if not quite hardcore - sex scenes make up the movie's mid-section and French porn aficionados should recognize the likes of Alain Plumey (a/k/a \"Cyril Val\"), Jacques Gateau and Elodie Delage, along with a blink and miss bit from future porno princess Marilyn Jess whose rape at the hands, mouth and member of Plumey was only present in the film's rarely screened XXX version FILLES TRAQUEES. The pivotal part of Véronique, a girl Elisabeth almost seems to remember and whom she seeks to escape anew with, is beautifully handled by the exquisite Dominique Journet - in her unforgettable debut - who would go on to play a sizable supporting role in Franco Zeffirelli's LA TRAVIATA. The six feet under ending reveals the deteriorating condition to be the result of a nuclear spill, the quarantined \"patients\" ultimately leaving a barely breathing empty shell, unceremoniously disposed off in a fiery furnace. The final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of Chaplin's MODERN TIMES as Elisabeth, approaching complete meltdown by now, and a wounded Robert stumble along the railroad bridge, clumsily clasping each other's outstretched hands.\n",

      "When I saw this film the first time I was very impressed concerning the kind of atmosphere the director creates. It is also very interesting to see how they imagine the near future in the year 1974. If you see the film you will see a lot of sets and customs which are called freaky and modern again today.<br /><br />The topic of the film deals with the old question \"What is real and what is illusion?\". If you see \"The Matrix\" you will find a lot of similarities. But the two films are not comparable at all because \"Welt am Draht\" is art and \"The Matrix\" is entertainment. If prefer the first one.<br /><br />Unfortunately I lost my video copy of it.<br /><br />\n",

      "] Haven't seen this film? Haven't even heard of this film? It wouldn't surprise me. One of the few truly \"independent\" films produced in the last ten years, no studio had faith in the picture and it was never picked up for major distribution. The independent company Kino Films, gave BOESMAN AND LENA a very limited run with virtually no promotion, and the majority of major film critics didn't even bother reviewing it. I guess a movie based on a one act, one set play about the apartheid and its affect on two individuals never really had a chance in today's market - and it's the intelligent film-lover's loss.<br /><br />For the record, both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserved Ocsar nominations (as did the cinematographer) but the film received such little fanfare that I can't even blame the academy on that one. This is a film that is challenging, thought-provoking, and heartbreaking, and it actually requires the audience to meet it on it's own terms. Taking that into consideration, it is definitely not a movie for mindless entertainment. Director John Berry wisely does not attempt to dress-up Athol Fugard's play. Sure, we're given a few fractured flashbacks and some breathtaking scenic shots, but the film version of BOESMAN AND LENA remains, on the whole, a story of two people living in inhumane conditions.<br /><br />Stripped of their basic human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) have no one left to attack but each other. A third character joins them for awhile (Willie Jonah, amazing in a largely silent role), but the film's focus never strays from the title characters and what they've become. Bassett and Glover give brave performances as the broken couple, performances that simply could not be improved upon. Vigorously and brutally stimulating, both intellectually and emotionally, BOESMAN AND LENA deserves to be rediscovered of home video. Hands down, the best film of the year 2000.\n",

      "Sharpe's Honour for the uninitiated, is the fifth entry in a series of TV movies focusing on an English army rifleman during the Napoleonic wars and based on the books by Bernard Cornwell (which I strongly recommend reading). If you were to start by watching this particular one though, you'd get the impression that Sharpe is not so much a soldier as the very centrifugal force which the rest of the army revolves around. Should that be the case, I'd recommend starting with earlier chapters like Sharpe's Eagle or Sharpe's Company, but this is a worthy choice for a second viewing.<br /><br />The story this time is all about the espionage side of things. With the French army retreating in disarray from Spain, Major Ducos, the slimy spy master spots an opportunity to turn the situation round. By pinning the murder of a Spanish Marques on Richard Sharpe, hero of the British army, the fragile British/Spanish alliance will start to crumble and things will turn around again. When the Spanish nobles come to Wellington crying for Sharpe's blood though, the English general is less than willing to hang his best soldier so fakes his death and soon, he's off on a secret mission behind enemy lines to find out who masterminded the plot. Surprisingly enough for a Sharpe film as well, there's a gorgeous woman to be rescued along the way, fancy that.<br /><br />What this results in of course is a more adventure style approach. The concentration is less on the workings of the English military with Sharpe as the figurehead and concentrates more on his escapades in the countryside, dodging French patrols, hob nobbing with the Spanish guerrillas and getting involved in daring escapes from fortified military positions. Sergeant Harper, his loyal right hand man accompanies him naturally but the rest of the riflemen remain in the camp unaware their leader is still alive. Strangely enough though, they actually receive more attention than usual as they wind up in their own subplot involving the delivery of Harper's baby.<br /><br />This slightly different approach makes for an intriguing episode but is only a good thing in the long run. And should anyone be worried that there won't be the standard battle at the climax fret not, because once again the poor old French get a right kicking. Furthermore, Ducos makes a fantastic successor to Obadiah Hakeswill as the bad guy you love to hate. He is a duplicitous, malicious and absolutely evil son of a female canine and is also strangely reminiscent of that guy in black from out of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Elsewhere, Hagman stands out quite prominently as he gets the chance for more screen time and comes across as the sort of man you'd want to deliver your first born, even if he does look like a member of Iron Maiden who got catapulted backwards in time by accident.<br /><br />In short then, another strong chapter in the Sharpe series. Sharpe remains as heroic as always but considerably more bitter and angry this time given the events in the previous film. It's not the best introduction if you've not seen any of the other chapters but it does show a side to Sharpe that we don't normally get to witness: the action hero rather than the professional soldier. And if that's not enough to get you tempted, it's also worth watching just for the rather surreal sight of an enraged Sean Bean swinging a live chicken at a group of nuns.\n",

      "Title: A Glimpse into the Zany World of 'Meet the Fockers' (2004)\n",
      "\n",
      "Directed by Jay Roach, \"Meet the Fockers\" serves as a sequel to the comedic hit \"Meet the Parents\" (2000). Released in 2004, this light-hearted comedy attempts to capitalize on the success of its predecessor, but does it hit the mark?\n",
      "\n",
      "The movie revolves around a clash of personalities between two families: the Byrnes and the Fockers. It reunites the audience with the familiar characters from the first film and introduces a fresh batch of eccentric individuals, which adds to the overall comedic atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the film's strengths lies in its talented ensemble cast. Robert De Niro is back in top form as the intimidating and overprotective ex-CIA father-in-law, Jack Byrnes, providing many of the film's most memorable moments. Ben Stiller reprises his role as Greg Focker, the nervous and hapless male lead, whose comedic timing perfectly complements De Niro's character.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding to the mix, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand join the cast as Greg's eccentric parents, Bernie and Roz Focker, injecting a new level of quirkiness with their colorful performances. Their presence adds an interesting dynamic to the film and generates some humorous and awkward situations that propel the story forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "The screenplay, while not reaching the same comedic heights as its predecessor, still manages to elicit laughs from its audience. The script contains a fair share of amusing one-liners and slapstick moments, which will likely entertain fans of this type of comedy. However, some jokes tend to rely on crude humor and innuendos, which may not appeal to all viewers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its comedic strengths, the film's pacing and storytelling suffer from a predictability that leaves little room for surprises. The plot is, at times, formulaic and predictable, as it follows a familiar pattern of misunderstandings, miscommunications, and chaotic scenarios. Consequently, the movie lacks a fresh perspective, making it somewhat underwhelming for those seeking a more inventive narrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of technical aspects, the film does exhibit a solid production value. The set design, cinematography, and clever use of comedic visual gags add to the overall charm of the movie. The soundtrack complements the various comedic sequences, further enhancing the film's lighthearted atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Meet the Fockers\" is a harmless and amusing comedy that, despite failing to surpass the original film, offers a few laughs and entertaining moments. Its talented cast and amusing performances ensure the film remains engaging, even if some of the humor feels forced or repetitive. Ultimately, viewers looking for a straightforward, light-hearted comedy may find this film enjoyable, while those seeking a more groundbreaking experience may be left disappointed.\n",

      "I recently watched a certain action-packed film that had a lot of hype surrounding it. While some people raved about its flashy special effects and thrilling explosions, I found myself somewhat disappointed. \n",
      "\n",
      "One major issue I had with this film was its lack of character development. The majority of the characters felt one-dimensional and uninteresting. It seemed like the filmmakers prioritized showcasing the larger-than-life robots over fleshing out the human characters. As a result, I struggled to connect with any of them on an emotional level, making it difficult for me to invest in their journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the storytelling felt quite disjointed and rushed. The plot jumped from one action sequence to another without giving the audience much time to comprehend what was happening. I found myself frequently confused about the motives of certain characters and the overall direction of the story. It felt like the filmmakers prioritized the spectacle over a coherent narrative, leaving me at times feeling detached from the whole experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the dialogue in the film was often cringe-worthy. Many of the lines seemed uninspired and lacked depth. It almost felt like the scriptwriters focused more on coming up with catchy one-liners rather than meaningful conversations. This shallow dialogue further hindered my ability to engage with the characters and invest in their struggles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although I must admit that the special effects were impressive, with some truly dazzling visual spectacles, they alone couldn't save the film. While the explosive action scenes did provide some excitement, they became overwhelming and repetitive after a while. The film relied too heavily on these sequences, sacrificing a chance to explore deeper themes or provide a more nuanced and satisfying viewing experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, this film may have delighted hardcore fans of the original franchise, but as a casual moviegoer, it failed to capture my interest. The lack of character development, rushed storytelling, shallow dialogue, and excessive reliance on explosive action left me feeling disconnected and unsatisfied.\n",

      "As an individual who often enjoys watching animated films, I recently stumbled upon a movie that left me somewhat underwhelmed. While it had its moments, this particular film failed to live up to my expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "One aspect that immediately struck me was the storyline. Although it started off with an intriguing premise, it quickly became predictable and lacked the depth I had hoped for. The plot felt somewhat disjointed, and the pacing seemed to falter at times, leaving me disengaged and disinterested in the events unfolding on screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another major disappointment was the character development. While the main protagonists initially showcased promising traits, their growth throughout the film was shallow and unconvincing. I found myself wishing for more complex and relatable characters, but unfortunately, they fell short of leaving any lasting impression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the overall visual aesthetic left much to be desired. Compared to other movies of its genre, the animation felt outdated and lacked the visual flair that I have come to expect from modern animated films. The design of certain characters seemed uninspired, failing to evoke any excitement or fascination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the comedic elements fell flat for me. The movie attempted to incorporate humor, but the jokes often felt forced and failed to elicit any genuine laughter. While comedy is subjective, this particular film's attempts at humor didn't resonate with my personal taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite my reservations, I must acknowledge that the film did have some redeeming qualities. The action sequences were moderately entertaining, although they failed to compensate for the shortcomings in other areas. Additionally, the voice acting was well done, with talented actors bringing the characters to life, but their performances couldn't save the movie from its lackluster execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this movie failed to captivate me as an audience member. Its predictable storyline, underdeveloped characters, outdated animation, and lackluster humor left me feeling disconnected from the cinematic experience. While it may have garnered praise from some quarters, I found it to be an underwhelming addition to the animated film canon.\n",

      "Schindler's List, released in 1993, is an absolutely extraordinary film that brilliantly captures the true story of Oskar Schindler and his remarkable efforts to save over a thousand Jewish lives during the Holocaust. Directed by the talented Steven Spielberg, this masterpiece remains one of the most powerful and emotional films ever made.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the very beginning, the film sets a somber and haunting tone that doesn't let up until the final credits roll. The black and white cinematography gives it a timeless quality, allowing us to focus on the raw emotions and human experiences portrayed. Every scene is masterfully crafted, displaying Spielberg's attention to detail and his dedication to accurately depicting the horrors of the Holocaust.\n",
      "\n",
      "The performances in Schindler's List are top-notch, with outstanding portrayals by Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as the ruthless SS officer Amon Goeth, and the incredible ensemble cast. Neeson brings a captivating mix of charisma, compassion, and complexity to his role, making Schindler a character that viewers instantly connect with and admire.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the film's greatest achievements is its ability to find moments of hope and humanity amidst the darkest of times. The story of Schindler's transformation, from a self-serving opportunist to a savior of lives, is both inspiring and heart-wrenching. It reminds us that even in the face of immense evil, an individual can make a significant difference and shine a light in the darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The musical score by John Williams is hauntingly beautiful, further enhancing the emotional impact of the film. Williams' compositions perfectly complement each scene, immersing the audience in the hearts and minds of the characters and the horrors they have to endure.\n",

      "As someone who enjoys watching movies for entertainment and escapism, I recently saw a film that I had high hopes for due to all the hype surrounding it. Sadly, this particular movie fell short of my expectations in several ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "First and foremost, the storyline felt incredibly cliché and predictable. It followed a typical 'fish out of water' plotline where the protagonist, an outsider, is drawn into a completely unfamiliar world. While this concept can be intriguing, I found the execution to be lacking originality. The narrative seemed overly simplistic and lacked the depth that I was hoping for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the characters failed to leave a lasting impression on me. The performances were acceptable, but the development of the characters felt weak. I didn't feel emotionally invested in their journeys, and as a result, I struggled to connect with them on a deeper level. I yearned for more complex and multidimensional characters that would make me care about their fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Visually, the movie boasted cutting-edge special effects and breathtaking visuals.

As a result, the story became overshadowed by the grandeur of the visual effects, leaving me feeling slightly disconnected and detached from the overall experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another aspect that disappointed me was the pacing of the film. It felt excessively long and dragged out at times. While I understand the desire to fully immerse the audience in this fantastical world, there were moments where the movie could have benefitted from tighter editing. The slow pace detracted from the overall excitement and action, leaving me occasionally bored and disengaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the messaging and themes presented in the film were hammered home in a heavy-handed manner. Rather than allowing me to interpret the deeper meaning behind the story, the movie seemed intent on spoon-feeding its moral lessons. This lack of subtlety made the film feel preachy and took away from the genuine exploration of important ideas.\n",
      "\n",

When it all gets a little too graphic for the date, she leaves. Michael follows. On the way home, they decide to take a shortcut through the local graveyard. There, it begins.\\n\\nThe actual thriller dance is amazing. It's full of those trademark Jackson moves, as well as some memorable zombie moves, too. It doesn't appear rushed at all, nor too long. The whole thing seems movie-like and it really is actually rather scary. Of course, it's one of the most famous music videos of all time, and is probably the greatest music video ever made as well.\\n\\nOverall: Watch it, seriously.

      "My wife comes from a pretty broken home, absentee alcoholic father, mostly raised by her grandma. \n",

We’ve been seeing a therapist since early December but really only a couple of times because of the holidays. Christmas was awkward. The whole feeling was miserable and uncomfortable, it didn’t feel like there was a lot to be happy or thankful for. Of course Emily picked up on that too. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sunday night, Emily and I get into a little argument. She tells me she’s feeling like my mom and SIL have cut her out of their girl outings. For me, this isn’t my problem. I’m still on the fence about even wanting to stay together and in reality I really think divorce is the best thing for me. I know she’s sorry, I know she “regrets” the affair, I guess I don’t care how she feels about it because I’m still trying to figure out how I feel,  but that’s not the point. I told her it’s not my problem. I told her I can’t repair the other relationships she’s broken. I’m not responsible for how they feel. I’m not responsible for fixing the other relationships she’s damaged. My parents and I are kind of on the outs at the moment. My dad and I are on the same page, divorce being best. But my mom has been pushing for me to stay in counseling and work it out, which has caused our (mine and my moms) relationship to be strained. I get it, people make mistakes, sure ok whatever. People do make mistakes but there’s consequences to those mistakes and losing the marriage is probably going to be one of them. I feel like I’m going crazy, my mom and SIL have cut her out, but they’re also the ones telling me I need to learn forgiveness and work on my marriage. Emily is openly upset with them and taking it on me. The only people defending her actions are the same ones she’s angry with. I feel like this piles on the shit show that is my life currently. I don’t want to deal with any of them anymore. I can’t take the constant contrarian view my mom gives me. I can’t take Emily being a whining sniveling shell of her former self, she has been feeble wanderer since the affair has come out, a far and stark difference from the head strong confident woman I married.  I feel like my whole life is strange and unknown and miserable out of nowhere. \n",

I have no idea how to break this to my mom who sees Emily as a member of family. Is there any chance of repairing the relationship with my mom? Or am I doomed to live this horrid soap opera for the rest of my existence? Shes so dead set that me and Emily can work this out, I feel like it’s going to put a huge wall between us. I also feel like I need to be completely away and out of Emily’s life, and I don’t think my mom will do that. She’s the kind of person who is more likely to reach out and help Emily than be concerned with how I feel. I have a sneaking suspicion my mom had an affair and my dad forgave her. I’m not my dad. I’m worried this is going to break my whole family and it’s not even anything I did or anywhere near my fault. How do I fix this mess?\n",

Until one day he told me that he was going to stay away from me for a while since I didn't like him anymore and he still had those feelings.  I agreed with his decision, but it's been a year since I last heard from him, they told me he has a girlfriend now, and that he's doing well, and that he somewhat misses me, he just struggles to reach out first.  I just miss him a lot as a friend and I don't know if it's a good idea to text him and try to be friends again, or if should forget about him and leave it at that.\n",

However, recently I found out that she went to see her ex-boyfriend without informing me beforehand, and it's really been eating away at me.\n",
      "\n",
      "To give you some context, it happened a few nights ago when I was out with friends. I came home to find my girlfriend acting a little distant and suspicious. After some probing, she eventually confessed that she had met up with her ex at his house while I was out. She claims it was a brief catch-up to clear any remaining tension, but the fact that she went alone and didn't tell me about it until I confronted her, makes me feel uneasy and slightly betrayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I trust my girlfriend, but this whole situation has made me question her intentions behind the meetup. I've voiced my concerns to her, explaining how it has made me feel uncomfortable and a bit insecure. She apologized for not being upfront about it, but didn't seem to fully understand why I have a problem with it. She assured me that nothing happened between them, and that she loves me.\n",

      "\n",
      "So, I (32M) work full-time at a demanding job while my spouse (30F) is a stay-at-home parent to our two young children. Recently, I've noticed a pattern of my wife not keeping up with the household chores and leaving the mess for me to clean up when I come home. It's become increasingly frustrating as it feels like I'm constantly coming home to chaos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't get me wrong, I understand that taking care of two kids is a stressful and demanding job. I genuinely appreciate and value the work my wife puts into raising our children. However, I believe that part of her responsibilities as a stay-at-home parent includes keeping the house in order. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried discussing this issue with my wife calmly and explaining how overwhelmed I feel coming home to a messy house after a long day at work. I've suggested creating a schedule or dividing the chores so that the burden doesn't solely fall on me. But every time we talk about it, she gets defensive and tells me that taking care of the children is already a full-time job.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that parenting is exhausting, but I also believe that managing the household responsibilities should be shared equally between partners. It's not fair for one person to have to do all the work outside of their regular employment, while the other person gets to relax at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm at a point where I feel resentful and unappreciated for everything I do to provide for our family. It feels like my wife is just taking advantage of the situation and expecting me to pick up after her and the kids. It's taking a toll on our relationship and I'm worried that if we can't find a solution, it may lead to even bigger issues down the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Reddit, am I the asshole for wanting my stay-at-home spouse to contribute more to the household chores? Should I just accept that taking care of the kids is enough and continue to clean up after everyone? I'm really struggling to see eye to eye with my wife on this matter and would appreciate any advice or perspective on the situation.\n",

      "Hi everyone,\n",
      "\n",
      "I recently found myself in a rather uncomfortable situation during our Christmas dinner, and I've been feeling a mix of emotions about how I reacted. I wanted to share it here and get some outside perspectives to see if I may have overreacted or if my response was justified. \n",
      "\n",
      "During Christmas dinner, my husband made a comment regarding my body in what seemed to be an observation rather than a compliment. Without thinking, I got up from my chair abruptly and shouted, \"SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MY BODYYYYY!\" The whole room fell silent, and I could sense the tension in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, here's some context. I've been struggling with body image issues for quite some time, and it's something I've confided in my husband about. While I understand that he may not have been aiming to hurt me intentionally, his comment hit a nerve and brought up all those negative feelings about myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think what bothered me most was how public his comment was, as it was made during a family gathering with several relatives present. It felt like he was not only pointing out my insecurities but also exposing them to everyone else around us. I felt humiliated and angry, hence my explosive outburst.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in hindsight, I can see that my reaction may have been excessive. It definitely disrupted the festive atmosphere and made everyone uncomfortable, probably including my husband. If this outburst was not an appropriate response, then maybe I should have handled it differently. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, Reddit, Am I the Asshole for getting up from my chair in the middle of Christmas dinner and shouting \"SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MY BODYYYYY\" in response to my husband's observation? I'm open to hearing your thoughts, opinions, and any potential advice on how I could handle such situations better in the future.\n",

      "\n",
      "Last night, we got into a heated argument over a trivial matter. Things quickly escalated, and he became extremely aggressive and physically violent. He started throwing objects around, breaking things, and screaming at the top of his lungs. I was frightened for my safety, so I locked myself in the bedroom and called the police.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the police arrived, they found my fiance still raging and causing a scene. They managed to calm him down and took him aside to talk. Meanwhile, I was shaking and crying, terrified of what just happened. They informed me that he would be taken into custody for his actions and ensured that I was safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's where the dilemma begins. Some of our friends and family members are now angry at me for involving the police. They argue that I should have given him one more chance since it was the first time he acted this way. They claim I overreacted and blew everything out of proportion, making it seem worse than it actually was.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, I strongly believe that calling the police was the right action. I couldn't risk my safety by waiting for him to potentially harm me further. The fact that he resorted to physical violence raises serious red flags to me. I couldn't simply brush it off as a one-time incident, especially when it endangered my well-being.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "My husband and I recently had a dispute with my in-laws, and I'm starting to wonder if I handled it the wrong way. Our four-year-old daughter, Lily, had her favorite doll stolen at a daycare recentlly, and she's been absolutely devastated ever since. She would constantly talk about how much she missed her doll and how sad she was without it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an attempt to cheer her up and replace her lost doll, my husband and I decided to ask my in-laws if they could buy her a new one as a gift, since they usually spoil our daughter with presents. However, when we brought up the idea to them, they flat out refused, saying that it wasn't their responsibility to replace the doll and that she should learn to cope with loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I understand the sentiment behind teaching kids about loss, I felt that they were being harsh and unsympathetic towards our daughter's feelings. I tried explaining that having a highly cherished toy stolen can be really traumatic for a child, and that a new doll would provide her with some comfort and a way to heal from the ordeal. But my in-laws were adamant that they wouldn't budge on this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Feeling frustrated and desperate, I insisted that it was their duty as grandparents to make their granddaughter happy, especially since they have the means to do so. I argued that they spoil her with gifts all the time, so why not make an exception in this particular situation?\n",
      "\n",
      "This led to a heated argument between us, with my in-laws accusing me of being entitled and solely focused on material possessions. They told me that I was spoiling our daughter and not teaching her any valuable life lessons by demanding a new doll. I fired back, saying that their refusal to help was selfish and showed a lack of empathy for our daughter's feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I can't help but wonder if I overreacted and if my insistence on them buying a new doll was unreasonable. On one hand, I do believe that grandparents should contribute to their grandchildren's happiness, if they're financially able to do so. On the other hand, perhaps I should have handled the situation differently and found a compromise that didn't involve insisting on them buying the doll.\n",

Not to mention the financial strain it would put on me and my fiancé.\n",

      "I tried speaking to my fiancé about this and he agrees that it's excessive. He's been trying to reason with his mother, but she isn't willing to budge. She believes that not attending any of these events would disrespect the family and bring shame upon them. It's a cultural thing for her, and I do respect that, but it's just too much!\n",

      "I suggested compromising by attending the events that are most important to my fiancé and his family, which would still be a considerable number, but it's a more manageable approach. However, my mother-in-law insists that we need to attend every single one of them.\n",

As someone who values honesty and integrity, I am unsure of what my role should be in this situation. Do I tell his girlfriend about his infidelity or should I stay out of it?\n",

      "To give you a bit of background, I've known my friend for years. We've shared countless moments together and have always been there for each other. However, during a recent gathering with some mutual friends, I inadvertently stumbled upon his unfaithful behavior when I witnessed him being cozy and intimately involved with someone who is not his girlfriend. It was an incredibly disheartening sight, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that his girlfriend deserves to know the truth.\n",

      "On one hand, I believe that honesty and transparency should be the foundation of any healthy relationship. I am genuinely concerned for his girlfriend's emotional well-being and think she deserves to be aware of her partner's actions. We often hear stories of people being hurt and betrayed when they discover their loved one's infidelity too late. If I were in her shoes, I would definitely want to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, there's the risk of losing my friendship with him if I choose to inform his girlfriend. I know confronting him about this will be a difficult conversation, and there's a chance he may deny or get defensive, putting a strain on our friendship. Moreover, I am unsure if it's my place to interfere in someone else's relationship, even if it's with good intentions. Is it worth potentially ruining a friendship over?\n",

      "\n",
      "Here's some context: My boyfriend and I have been together for a year, and overall, our relationship has been pretty solid. However, recently, he expressed an interest in dating someone significantly younger than him. When he mentioned this, I felt uncomfortable and told him that it wasn't something I was okay with. Call me traditional, but the age gap just doesn't sit well with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to a few days ago, we were discussing our living situation. I currently live in a small, budget-friendly apartment that I can afford comfortably. It may not be luxurious, but it's cozy and it fits my needs. During that conversation, my boyfriend made a snide comment about my apartment, saying it was too frugal for his liking. I was taken aback and felt hurt by his insensitive remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, here's where the conflict arises. I got upset and told him that if he wants to date someone younger, he should be prepared to be able to afford a more expensive lifestyle because younger individuals tend to have different preferences and expectations. I also pointed out that his comment about my apartment was unfair, considering he knew about it before.\n",
      "\n",
      "We argued for a while, both defending our respective sides. He accused me of being controlling and not respecting his preferences, while I argued that it was normal for me to feel uncomfortable with him pursuing younger individuals. At this point, we're at a bit of a standoff, both feeling misunderstood and angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Reddit, AITA for telling my boyfriend that he can't date younger and subsequently getting upset about his comment on my budget apartment? I genuinely want to understand if I'm being unreasonable or if there's a better way to handle this situation.\n",

      "prompt: Please write a wikipedia-style introduction to the following topic of approximately 600 words, without sections or a concluding or summary sentence: Kettling\n",
      "\t***AI-generated text***\n",
      "Kettling, also known as containment or mass arrest, is a crowd control tactic commonly employed by law enforcement authorities to manage and control protests or demonstrations. This controversial method involves surrounding and confining a large group of individuals within a restricted area for an extended period. The practice of kettling has been widely criticized due to concerns over its impact on civil liberties, human rights, and potential abuse of power. While supporters argue that it mitigates violence and ensures public safety, opponents contend that it infringes upon the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "The exact origins of kettling are difficult to trace, but the technique has been employed by law enforcement agencies in various countries and time periods. The term itself is believed to have originated in the late 20th century in the United Kingdom, particularly during protests against globalization, such as the 1999 protests against the World Trade Organization in Seattle, Washington. Kettling gained further recognition during the anti-globalization movements of the early 2000s, as well as subsequent protests, becoming a contentious issue in discussions surrounding civil liberties and protest management.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typically, kettling involves forming a barrier of police officers or riot police around a group of protesters, blocking their exit routes and confining them within a predetermined area. This area is often referred to as a kettle, reflecting the metaphorical notion of containing or trapping individuals within a confined space. Boundary lines are established, and protesters are restricted from leaving the designated area without facing apprehension or arrest. The tactic is intended to deter and control potentially disruptive behavior and prevent incidents of violence or property damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, critics argue that kettling can lead to the deprivation of individuals' basic rights. Detainees are often held in the kettle for an extended period, sometimes hours, under conditions that may be crowded, tense, and uncomfortable. This confinement has been criticized for its impact on individuals' ability to exercise their freedom of movement, access basic amenities like food, water, and restrooms, and seek medical attention when needed. Detractors argue that being held within a kettle restricts protesters from exercising their right to peacefully disperse, arguably infringing upon their freedom of assembly and expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, concerns exist pertaining to potential police misconduct and the excessive use of force during kettling. Critics contend that such practices may result in the mistreatment of peaceful protesters, as well as arbitrarily targeting and detaining innocent individuals. Instances of kettling escalating into violent clashes between protesters and police have been reported in various incidents, exacerbating calls for restrictions or prohibitions on the tactic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Supporters of kettling argue that it serves as an effective means of crowd control by preventing unlawful behavior during protests. They maintain that kettling enables law enforcement to identify and isolate individuals involved in criminal activities, maintain public safety, and protect public and private property from potential damage. Kettling is viewed as an essential tactic for managing large-scale protests or demonstrations where tensions may run high and the potential for violent outbreaks is heightened.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proponents also stress the importance of proportionality and oversight in the implementation of kettling. They argue that when properly regulated, respecting individuals' rights and guided by clear protocols, kettling can be a responsible method of crowd management. Critics and supporters alike acknowledge the need for transparency, accountability, and ongoing dialogue between law enforcement agencies and civil society regarding the use of kettling and its impact on civil liberties.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, kettling is a controversial crowd control tactic employed by law enforcement authorities to manage and control protests or demonstrations. While proponents emphasize its efficacy in maintaining public safety and preventing violence, opponents raise concerns regarding its impact on civil liberties, the restriction of peaceful assembly, and potential abuses of power. The debate surrounding kettling continues to evolve as authorities, activists, and organizations strive to strike a balance between public safety, civic rights, and effective protest management.\n",

      "A municipal corporation is the legal term for a local governing body, including (but not necessarily limited to) cities, counties, towns, townships, charter townships, villages, and boroughs. The term can also be used to describe municipally owned corporations.\n",
      "Municipal incorporation occurs when such municipalities become self-governing entities under the laws of the state or province in which they are located. Often, this event is marked by the award or declaration of a municipal charter. A city charter or town charter or municipal charter is a legal document establishing a municipality, such as a city or town.\n",
      "In Canada, charters are granted by provincial authorities.\n",
      "The Greater Chennai Corporation is the oldest municipal corporation in the world outside the United Kingdom.\n",
      "The title \"corporation\" was used in boroughs from soon after the Norman conquest until the Local Government Act 2001. Under the 2001 act, county boroughs were renamed \"cities\" and their corporations became \"city councils\"; other borough corporations were renamed \"borough councils\".After the Partition of Ireland, the corporations in the Irish Free State were Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford (county boroughs) and Drogheda, Kilkenny, Sligo, Clonmel, and Wexford (non-county boroughs). Dún Laoghaire gained borough status in 1930 as \"The Corporation of Dun Laoghaire\". Galway's borough status, lost in 1840, was restored in 1937; it was formally styled \"the Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of the Borough of Galway\", but referred to as \"the Corporation\".\n",
      "The New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 allowed municipal corporations to be established within the new Provinces of New Zealand. The term fell out of favour following the abolition of the Provinces in 1876.\n",
      "The ancient boroughs of England and Wales were typically incorporated by a royal charter, though some were boroughs by prescription. The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 and Municipal Corporations Act 1882 abolished the corporations of rotten boroughs and other small rural areas. The Local Government Act 1888 aligned the powers of the remaining borough corporations with those of the new urban district councils. All borough corporations were replaced under the Local Government Act 1972 with councils not designated as \"corporations\", with the exception of the City of London Corporation.\n",
      "The corporations of the burghs of Scotland were similar in origin and were reformed or replaced in the nineteenth century before being abolished by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. The Irish borough corporations within what is now Northern Ireland were reformed by the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 and Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 and replaced by the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972.\n",
      "According to one definition of the term, municipal corporations are \"organisations with independent corporate status, managed by an executive board appointed primarily by local government officials, and with majority public ownership\". Some such corporations rely on revenue from user fees, distinguishing them from agencies and special districts funded through taxation, although this is not always the case. Such municipal corporations result from a process of \"externalization\", and require different skills and orientations from the respective local governments, and follow common changes in the institutional landscape of public services. They are argued to be more efficient than government bureaucracies, but have higher failure rates because of their legal and managerial autonomy.\n",

      "\t***AI-generated text***\n",
      "The Tiruchirapalli Rock Fort, also known as the Trichy Rock Fort or just Rockfort, is a historic landmark located in the city of Tiruchirapalli in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Situated on a massive rock formation, the fort offers breathtaking views of the city and stands proudly as a symbol of its rich history and architectural grandeur.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rock Fort is believed to have existed for over 2,500 years and has stood witness to the rise and fall of various dynasties that have ruled this region. It holds immense cultural and religious significance, with several temples and shrines nestled within its walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fort complex is divided into two main parts: the lower fort and the upper fort. The lower fort includes a bustling market area known as the Uchipillayar Koil Street, where one can find shops selling traditional handicrafts, textiles, and jewelry. The street also houses various eateries that offer delicious local delicacies, attracting both locals and tourists alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the entrance of the lower fort stands the Ucchi Pillayar Koil, which translates to \"temple of the Lord Vinayaka at the top.\" This temple is dedicated to Lord Ganesha, the elephant-headed Hindu deity, and is a popular pilgrimage site for devotees. The temple is believed to have been built during the fifth century by the Pallava dynasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "To reach the upper fort, visitors must climb a series of steep steps carved into the rock face. As they ascend, they are greeted by the awe-inspiring sight of the Thayumanaswamy Temple, perched atop the rock. This temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is Trichy's most prominent religious site. It dates back to the seventh century and is a testament to the Dravidian style of architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the Thayumanaswamy Temple, visitors can witness intricately carved pillars, stunning frescoes, and vibrant murals that depict scenes from Hindu mythology. The temple complex also houses several smaller shrines dedicated to various deities, adding to its religious significance. The annual Float Festival, held in the temple tank, attracts a large number of devotees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from its religious significance, the Rock Fort is also home to the Samayapuram Mariamman Temple, dedicated to the deity Mariamman, the Hindu goddess of rain and fertility. This temple is famous for its elaborate rituals and vibrant festivals, drawing devotees from far and wide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rock Fort has been conquered and ruled by various dynasties throughout history, including the Pallavas, Cholas, Vijayanagar Empire, Nayaks, Marathas, and the British. Each ruling power has left its mark on the fort, with different structures and additions reflecting their distinct architectural styles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fort's strategic location has made it a coveted stronghold over the centuries. Its position on top of a rock not only provided a natural vantage point for defense but also made it resistant to attacks. The British used the fort as a military garrison during their rule, and remnants of their occupation can still be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the top of the Rock Fort, visitors are rewarded with panoramic views of Tiruchirapalli and its surroundings. The bustling city sprawls beneath, with its patchwork of commercial and residential areas, temples, and vibrant markets. The nearby Kaveri River meanders through the landscape, enhancing the picturesque panorama.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, the Tiruchirapalli Rock Fort stands as a testament to the rich heritage and architectural prowess of the past. Its religious and cultural significance, coupled with its breathtaking views, makes it a popular tourist destination. Visitors can explore its temples, absorb its history, and marvel at the engineering marvel that is the Rock Fort.\n",

Until September 2014, there were five, when the Central Governorate was abolished.Each governorate is governed by a Governor, appointed by the Prime Minister, and has its own municipality council, with separate elections for them. The first municipal elections in Bahrain held after independence in 1971, was held in conjunction with the 2002 Bahraini general election. The most recent was held in conjunction with the 2018 Bahraini general election.\n",

The municipality was in charge of cleaning roads and renting buildings to tenants and shops. The first municipal elections, to fill half the seats on local councils, were held in 1926. By 1929, it undertook road expansions as well as opening markets and slaughterhouses.In 1958, the municipality started water purification projects. In 1960, Bahrain comprised four municipalities: Manama, Hidd, Al Muharraq, and Riffa.  Over the next 30 years, the four municipalities were divided into 12 municipalities as settlements such as Hamad Town and Isa Town grew. These municipalities were administered from Manama under a central municipal council whose members are appointed by the king.Since 22 September 2014, Bahrain has been divided into four governorates:\n",
      "Each governorate is divided into a specific number of constituencies for the election of the country's Council of Representatives. Each constituency is listed as area 1, area 2 etc. Elections are held in these constituencies every four years, with each constituency electing one member. The most recent election was the 2018 Bahraini general election. Only Bahraini citizens are entitled to stand for and to vote at elections.\n",

      "The 1944 Democratic National Convention was a pivotal political event in American history, held from July 19 to July 21, 1944, in Chicago, Illinois. As the nation was navigating through the tumultuous landscape of World War II, this convention played a crucial role in shaping the course of the Democratic Party and determining the future of the United States. The gathering featured intense debates, strategic maneuvering, and ultimately the nomination of President Franklin D. Roosevelt for an unprecedented fourth term as the Democratic candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Against the backdrop of war, the 1944 Democratic National Convention brought together delegates from all fifty states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and the Philippines. At a time when the nation's attention was riveted on overseas military operations, this convention served as a platform for democratic deliberations and the selection of a presidential candidate charged with leading the country through the ongoing war effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "The convention was marked by a strong sense of unity among Democrats as they rallied behind President Roosevelt, who had steered the nation through the Great Depression and was widely respected for his leadership during the war. The delegates viewed Roosevelt as a steady hand capable of ensuring victory over both the Axis powers abroad and the economic challenges on the home front. His New Deal policies and commitment to social welfare resonated with many within the party who advocated for progressive reforms. Roosevelt's popularity also stemmed from his ability to inspire confidence and foster a sense of hope during times of crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, various factions in the Democratic Party held differing views on important domestic and foreign policy issues. The presence of these divisions added an element of intrigue and drama to the convention proceedings. Key debates revolved around issues such as civil rights, the role of labor unions, and the approach to post-war reconstruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most significant moments of the convention was the unveiling of the Democratic Party platform, a document that outlined the party's stance on numerous issues. The 1944 platform emphasized commitments to a wide range of social and economic reforms, including expanded opportunities for education, affordable housing, and fair labor practices. It also pledged support for the establishment of an international organization aimed at maintaining peace and preventing future global conflicts – a precursor to the United Nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, the 1944 Democratic National Convention played a pivotal role in advancing civil rights. African American delegates and activists played an influential role by advocating for stronger anti-discrimination legislation, greater representation for minorities, and an end to racial segregation. Their efforts led to the insertion of a historic anti-poll tax plank in the party platform, signaling an important step forward for civil rights advocacy within the Democratic Party.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, the convention overwhelmingly nominated Roosevelt as the Democratic candidate for president. With Vice President Henry A. Wallace as his running mate, Roosevelt embarked on a campaign that appealed to both the traditional Democratic base and the growing number of independent voters who admired his wartime leadership. Despite some opposition from conservative elements within the party and lingering doubts about the viability of a fourth term, Roosevelt's popularity and unparalleled political acumen prevailed. His nomination at the 1944 Democratic National Convention solidified his position as a transformative figure in American politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1944 Democratic National Convention will always be remembered as a pivotal moment in American political history. It was a time of unity and division, hope and uncertainty, held against the backdrop of a nation immersed in a world war. The decisions made during those intense three days in Chicago shaped not only the course of the Democratic Party but also the future of the United States. The convention underscored the importance of youthful enthusiasm, progressive ideals, and the power of unity in the face of adversity. Its profound impact resonates to this day, reminding us of the crucial role that political conventions play in shaping our democracy.\n",

The team played its home games at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana, as a member of the Big Ten Conference.\n",
      "Despite the highs of the previous season and being ranked as high as No. 3 in the nation, the Hoosiers faced a troubling and disappointing year; they finished 18–16 overall and 7–11 in Big Ten play to finish in a tie for 10th place. At the Big Ten tournament they defeated Iowa in the second round to advance to the quarterfinals where they lost to Wisconsin. The Hoosiers missed out on the NCAA tournament and lost in the first round of the NIT, their first appearance since 2005, to Georgia Tech. The game was played at Georgia Tech's McCamish Pavilion because Indiana Athletic Director Fred Glass declined to host a home game at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall citing concern it would \"devalue\" the Hoosiers' home court.On March 16, 2017, Indiana fired Crean after nine years as head coach. On March 25, 2017, the school hired Archie Miller as head coach.\n",

      "\t***AI-generated text***\n",
      "The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) is an intergovernmental body within the United Nations (UN) system responsible for promoting and protecting human rights worldwide. Established in 2006, the UNHRC succeeded and replaced the former United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR), which had faced criticism for perceived biases and ineffectiveness. The council serves as a forum for member states to address pressing human rights issues, review the human rights records of UN member states, and establish international standards to promote and protect human rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "The creation of the UNHRC was a response to the need for a more efficient and effective international mechanism to address human rights concerns. The UNCHR, while an important body for human rights, had flaws that undermined its credibility. The new council was designed to address these shortcomings and bring about positive changes in the promotion and protection of human rights worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the key strengths of the UNHRC lies in its composition. Unlike the UNCHR, membership in the council is based on equitable geographical distribution, with seats allocated to regional groups. Each region is represented by a certain number of states, which are elected by the UN General Assembly for a three-year term. This composition helps ensure a diverse range of perspectives and voices in the discussions and decisions of the council.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UNHRC holds regular sessions throughout the year, during which member states, observer states, and non-governmental organizations can raise concerns and engage in debate on various human rights issues. The council has a broad mandate, covering civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights. It addresses a wide range of thematic and country-specific human rights situations, allowing member states to collectively work towards solutions and actions to address human rights violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "A distinctive feature of the UNHRC is its Universal Periodic Review (UPR), a mechanism through which all UN member states' human rights records are periodically assessed. The UPR cycle, lasting approximately four and a half years, involves a comprehensive review of each country’s human rights commitments, progress, and challenges. During the review, member states provide information on measures taken to improve human rights situations, and recommendations are made to guide future actions. The UPR contributes to accountability and transparency, fostering dialogue and cooperation among states to address shortcomings and promote the protection of human rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the UPR, the UNHRC has established several special procedures, such as independent experts and working groups, to address specific human rights issues or countries of concern. These experts and groups act as rapporteurs, conducting investigations, reporting on human rights situations, and advising on necessary actions. They play a crucial role in promoting dialogue, offering technical assistance, and advocating for the protection of human rights in various contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another significant function of the UNHRC is its ability to respond promptly to emergencies and urgent human rights situations through special sessions. These sessions can be convened at the request of member states or the UN Secretary-General to address crises requiring immediate attention. This flexibility allows the council to react swiftly to emerging or escalating human rights violations, supporting efforts to protect individuals at risk and promote stability and peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Critics of the UNHRC argue that it is not entirely free from political influence and that some member states with poor human rights records have been elected to the council. The perceived double standards in addressing human rights situations in different parts of the world have also been a subject of scrutiny. However, proponents of the council assert that it provides an open and inclusive platform for dialogue and cooperation, enabling states to engage constructively and address human rights concerns collectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the United Nations Human Rights Council is an essential component of the UN system, addressing human rights challenges and promoting the fundamental rights and freedoms of all individuals. While it faces ongoing debates and challenges, the council remains indispensable for fostering dialogue, cooperation, and accountability in the global human rights landscape. As it continues to evolve and adapt to changing contexts, the UNHRC plays a vital role in advocating for a more just and equal world where human rights are universally respected.\n",

      "\t***AI-generated text***\n",
      "A mountain is a large landform that rises prominently above its surroundings, typically with steep slopes, rugged terrain, and towering peaks reaching towards the sky. These majestic natural wonders have captivated and inspired humans for centuries, serving as formidable obstacles, spiritual symbols, and breathtaking scenic vistas. Defined by their geological characteristics, mountains are formed through tectonic activity, volcanic eruptions, or erosional processes. With their diverse ecosystems, rich biodiversity, and important water sources, mountains play a crucial role in shaping the Earth's physical and ecological landscapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Characterized by their lofty heights and commanding presence, mountains vary widely in terms of size, shape, and appearance. These imposing features can be found on every continent and encompass vast ranges such as the Himalayas in Asia, the Andes in South America, the Rockies in North America, and the Alps in Europe. Each mountain range possesses its own distinct geological history, unique climate, and indigenous plant and animal life, making them captivating study subjects for geologists, biologists, and environmental scientists alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "The formation of mountains is a complex process that often spans millions of years. One common mechanism of mountain formation is tectonic activity, which occurs due to the movement and collision of lithospheric plates beneath the Earth's surface. When two plates collide, immense pressure and forces cause uplift, leading to the formation of vast mountain systems. The Himalayas, for example, resulted from the collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates, resulting in the highest peak on Earth, Mount Everest. Over time, these mountains continue to be shaped through the ongoing uplift, erosion, and weathering processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Volcanic activity is another significant process that contributes to mountain formation. Volcanoes are formed by the accumulation of lava and other volcanic materials over time, which build up to create towering volcanic peaks. Some of the world's most renowned mountain ranges, such as the Cascades in North America and the Andes, are the result of volcanic processes. From the explosive eruptions of stratovolcanoes to the quieter effusive eruptions of shield volcanoes, volcanic activity plays a vital role in the creation and alteration of mountain landscapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Erosional processes, on the other hand, shape older mountains that have withstood the test of time. Over millions of years, weathering and the action of glaciers, wind, and water gradually wear down mountains, sculpting their steep slopes and rugged terrain into unique formations. Erosion can create iconic features such as deep canyons, sharp ridges, and dramatic cliffs. The Appalachian Mountains in eastern North America are a prime example of a mountain range that has undergone extensive erosion over hundreds of millions of years, resulting in gentle rolling hills and rounded peaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mountains not only showcase extraordinary geological processes but also house an astonishing array of ecosystems. Due to the variation in altitude, temperature, and precipitation, mountains feature distinct climate zones and host a diverse collection of plant and animal species. From the lush rainforests nestled in the foothills to the alpine meadows teeming with vibrant wildflowers, mountains are a haven for biodiversity. They serve as vital habitats for numerous endangered species, provide shelter to unique endemic plants, and act as critical water towers, supplying freshwater to countless regions downstream.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, mountains have played significant cultural and spiritual roles throughout history. In many societies, mountains are revered as sacred sites and serve as pilgrimage destinations for religious and spiritual purposes. They are often associated with awe-inspiring beauty, spiritual reflection, and enlightenment. Mountains have been depicted in art, literature, and mythology as symbols of strength, endurance, and transcendence, inspiring human imagination and creativity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, mountains are awe-inspiring landforms that have captivated humans for centuries. Their striking presence, geological diversity, and ecological importance make them fascinating subjects of study. From the powerful forces that shape them to the delicate ecosystems they sustain, mountains continue to shape our planet's landscape, provide valuable resources, and offer endless opportunities for exploration and admiration.\n",

      "Marsupials are any members of the mammalian infraclass Marsupialia. All extant marsupials are endemic to Australasia, Wallacea and the Americas. A distinctive characteristic common to most of these species is that the young are carried in a pouch. Living marsupials include kangaroos, koalas, opossums, Tasmanian devils, wombats, wallabies, and bandicoots among others, while many extinct species, such as the thylacine, Thylacoleo, and Diprotodon, are also known.\n",
      "Marsupials represent the clade originating from the last common ancestor of extant metatherians, the group containing all mammals more closely related to marsupials than to placentals. Placentals and marsupials diverged from each other at least 125 million years ago, and possibly over 160 million years ago, during the Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous. Marsupials give birth to relatively undeveloped young that often reside in a pouch located on their mothers' abdomen for a certain amount of time. Close to 70% of the 334 extant species occur on the Australian continent (the mainland, Tasmania, New Guinea and nearby islands). The remaining 30% are found in the Americas—primarily in South America, thirteen in Central America, and one species, the Virginia opossum, in North America, north of Mexico.\n",
      "The word marsupial comes from marsupium, the technical term for the abdominal pouch. It, in turn, is borrowed from the Latin marsupium and ultimately from the ancient Greek μάρσιππος mársippos, meaning \"pouch\".\n",
      "Marsupials have the typical characteristics of mammals—e.g., mammary glands, three middle ear bones, and true hair. There are, however, striking differences as well as a number of anatomical features that separate them from eutherians.\n",
      "Most female marsupials have a front pouch, which contains multiple teats for the sustenance of their young. Marsupials also have other common structural features. Ossified patellae are absent in most modern marsupials (though a small number of exceptions are reported) and epipubic bones are present. Marsupials (and monotremes) also lack a gross communication (corpus callosum) between the right and left brain hemispheres.\n",
      "The skull has peculiarities in comparison to placental mammals. In general, the skull is relatively small and tight. Holes (foramen lacrimale) are located in the front of the orbit. The cheekbone is enlarged and extends farther to the rear. The angular extension (processus angularis) of the lower jaw is bent toward the center. The hard palate has more openings than placental mammals' foramina. The teeth also differ from that of placental mammals. For example, all Australia marsupials not in the order Diprotodontia have a different number of incisors in the upper and lower jaws. The early marsupials had a dental formula from 5.1.3.44.1.3.4, that is, per quadrant; they have five (maxillary) or four (mandibular) incisors, one canine, three premolars and four molars, for a total of 50 teeth. Some taxa, such as the opossum, have the original number of teeth. In other groups the number of teeth is reduced. The dental formula for Macropodidae (kangaroos and wallabies etc.) is 3/1 – (0 or 1)/0 – 2/2 – 4/4. Marsupials in many cases have 40 to 50 teeth, significantly more than most placental mammals. The second set of teeth grows in only at the 3rd premolar site and back; all teeth more anterior to that erupt initially as permanent teeth.\n",

      "\t***AI-generated text***\n",
      "Simplicius of Cilicia was a renowned philosopher and commentator of the late ancient period. Born in Cilicia, a region in southeastern Anatolia, now part of modern-day Turkey, Simplicius lived during the 6th century AD and is primarily known for his significant contributions to the field of Neoplatonism. His extensive commentaries on the works of Aristotle and other prominent ancient thinkers played a crucial role in preserving and transmitting their teachings to future generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simplicius emerged as a key figure within the broader school of Neoplatonism, which sought to reconcile the philosophical traditions of Plato and Aristotle with elements of the mystical and religious practices of the time. Neoplatonists, including Simplicius, aimed to find the common ground between these philosophical systems and to synthesize them into a coherent worldview. Their doctrines were influential in shaping the intellectual landscape of late antiquity and had a lasting impact on the development of Western philosophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Little is known about Simplicius' early life and education, but it is believed he received scholarly training in Alexandria, one of the most prominent centers of learning in the ancient world. It was in Alexandria where Simplicius likely encountered the works of previous Neoplatonic thinkers, such as Plotinus and Proclus, whose ideas profoundly influenced his own philosophical pursuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simplicius' most notable works are his commentaries on Aristotle's writings, which provided detailed interpretations and explications of the renowned philosopher's ideas. These commentaries covered various disciplines, including metaphysics, physics, and natural philosophy. Through his meticulous analysis, Simplicius shed light on the intricate nuances of Aristotle's thought, allowing subsequent generations to better understand and appreciate the wisdom contained within these ancient texts.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of Simplicius' renowned commentaries is his analysis of Aristotle's work on physics, known as the \"Physics Commentaries.\" In this extensive text, Simplicius diligently examined Aristotle's conceptualization of the natural world, delving into topics such as motion, causality, and the fundamental principles underlying physical phenomena. Simplicius' commentary not only clarified Aristotle's often complex and enigmatic arguments but also added his own insights and interpretations. These profound contributions greatly enhanced the understanding of Aristotle's physics and influenced subsequent generations of scholars.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to his commentaries on Aristotle, Simplicius also engaged with other ancient thinkers, such as Plato and the Stoics, bringing their perspectives into the Neoplatonic framework. Through his commentaries on Plato's works, Simplicius explored the notions of the Forms, the nature of the soul, and the role of dialectic in philosophical inquiry. Simplicius' integrative approach allowed him to incorporate diverse philosophical strands into a cohesive whole, providing a comprehensive understanding of the ancient philosophical canon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simplicius' impact on the preservation of ancient knowledge extended beyond his commentaries. He wrote extensively on various philosophical topics, including ethics, cosmology, and theology. Although many of these original works have not survived, references to them in later texts attest to their considerable influence and significance. Simplicius played a vital role in the transmission of philosophical ideas from ancient Greece to subsequent generations, ensuring their continued relevance and inspiring further philosophical investigations.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the decline of the Neoplatonic school in Athens, Simplicius likely sought refuge in the court of the Persian king Khosrow I, further contributing to the dissemination of philosophical knowledge in the East. His dialogues with Khosrow I, which touched upon themes of ethics and metaphysics, offered valuable insights into the dialogical approach to philosophical inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simplicius of Cilicia stands as a significant figure in the history of ancient philosophy, particularly within the Neoplatonic tradition. His commentaries on Aristotle's works and his explorations of various philosophical systems illuminated the intellectual heritage of antiquity, ensuring its preservation and promoting further philosophical developments in the medieval and early modern periods. Simplicius' contributions continue to be celebrated for their enduring impact on Western philosophy, solidifying his position as a prominent and influential thinker.\n",

In Indian culture, names hold profound significance and play a crucial role in an individual's life. The importance of names is deeply rooted in the country's diverse and ancient cultural heritage.  Names are also influenced by religion and caste and may come from epics. In Hindu culture, names are often chosen based on astrological and numerological principles. It is believed that a person's name can influence their destiny, and selecting the right name is essential for a prosperous and harmonious life. Astrologers may be consulted to ensure a name aligns with the individual's birth chart. India's population speaks a wide variety of languages and nearly every major religion in the world has a following in India. This variety makes for subtle, often confusing, differences in names and naming styles. Due to historical Indian cultural influences, several names across South and Southeast Asia are influenced by or adapted from Indian names or words.In some cases, an Indian birth name is different from their official name; the birth name starts with a selected name from the person's horoscope (based on the nakshatra or lunar mansion corresponding to the person's birth).\n",

      "Xu Zhi (died 254) was a military general of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China. He participated in a battle against an invading army from Wei's rival state, Shu Han, led by the Shu general Jiang Wei. His name is sometimes incorrectly romanised as Xu Zi.\n",
      "In 254, the Wei-appointed official in charge of Didao County defected to Shu and surrendered, after which the Shu troops under Jiang Wei's command entered Wei territory without being challenged until they reached Xiangwu (襄武). There, Xu Zhi organised the local defences to resist the Shu invasion. During the ensuing battle, Zhang Ni while leading the vanguard of the Shu forces was killed though those he killed and injured were also numerous. Xu Zhi, himself was killed and defeated by Jiang Wei with the rest of the Wei forces retreating. The victorious Shu forces then occupied three counties – Didao, Heguan (河關; in the vicinity of present-day Dingxi, Gansu) and Lintao – and forced the residents to relocate to Shu-controlled territory.\n",
      "In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Xu Zhi volunteers to lead the Wei vanguard to engage Jiang Wei in battle. The two armies encounter each other at Dong Village (董亭) and get into their respective formations. Xu Zhi charges out of the Wei formation and duels with the Shu general Liao Hua. Soon after, Liao Hua takes advantage of a feint and retreats. Zhang Yi continues the duel against Xu Zhi but retreats as well after a few rounds. Xu Zhi then leads his troops on a charge and defeats the enemy. Later, Xu Zhi is caught in a surprise attack led by Liao Hua and Zhang Yi. Though his force is wiped out, Xu Zhi manages to escape alive; he ultimately falls into an ambush and meets his end at the hands of Jiang Wei's men.\n",

      "\t***AI-generated text***\n",
      "Adam Smith (1723-1790) was a prominent Scottish philosopher and economist who is widely regarded as the father of modern economics. His groundbreaking work, \"The Wealth of Nations,\" published in 1776, laid the foundation for classical economic theory and significantly shaped the field of economics as we know it today. Smith's ideas on free markets, division of labor, and the invisible hand have had a lasting impact on economic thought and continue to influence economic policies worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Born in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, on June 5, 1723, Smith grew up in a modest family and received a comprehensive education at the University of Glasgow and Balliol College, Oxford. During his studies, he developed a keen interest in moral philosophy, which later became one of the pillars of his economic theories. In 1751, he returned to the University of Glasgow and began teaching as a professor of logic and later as a professor of moral philosophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smith's fundamental work, \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments,\" published in 1759, explored the ethical principles underlying human behavior and morality. In this book, Smith argued that individual actions are guided by sympathy and moral sentiments, rather than solely by self-interest. He emphasized the role of impartial spectator judgments in shaping human behavior, suggesting that people strive for moral approval from society.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it was Smith's magnum opus, \"An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,\" that propelled him into intellectual fame. Published in 1776, this seminal work presented a comprehensive analysis of the economic forces driving wealth creation and distribution. Smith advocated for an economic system based on free markets, arguing that individuals pursuing their self-interest would naturally lead to the betterment of society as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Wealth of Nations\" outlined Smith's theory of the invisible hand, a concept that has become one of the most enduring and widely debated ideas in economics. Smith argued that, in a market economy, individual self-interests guided by the price mechanism would promote overall economic prosperity. He contended that individuals seeking personal gain in competitive markets unintentionally benefit society as if guided by an invisible hand, leading to the optimal allocation of resources and the overall improvement of living standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smith's work on the division of labor also contributed significantly to economic thought. He highlighted the efficiencies gained through specialization, recognizing that when individuals focus on performing specific tasks, overall production and productivity increase. Smith famously illustrated this concept by analyzing a simple pin-making process, demonstrating the tremendous increases in productivity achieved through division of labor.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to his economic theories, Smith also discussed various issues related to trade, taxation, and government policies in \"The Wealth of Nations.\" Importantly, he criticized the prevailing mercantilist policies of his time, which heavily relied on government intervention and protectionist measures. Smith argued for free trade and the removal of trade barriers as he believed it would stimulate economic growth and benefit all nations involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smith's ideas had a remarkable impact not only on economic thought but also on political philosophy. He emphasized the importance of limited government intervention and the protection of individual freedoms. Smith believed that government should only have a minimal role in the economy, focusing primarily on maintaining law and order, enforcing contracts, and protecting property rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the publication of \"The Wealth of Nations,\" Smith's ideas spread rapidly and gained widespread recognition. His work provided a theoretical foundation and intellectual framework for the emerging field of economics, shaping the thinking of subsequent economists such as David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, and Karl Marx. Smith's ideas were influential during the Industrial Revolution and contributed to the policy shifts toward free trade and market capitalism that characterized the 19th and 20th centuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adam Smith's significant contributions to economics earned him enduring recognition and influence, solidifying his position as one of the most influential thinkers in history. His ideas on free markets, the invisible hand, and the division of labor continue to shape economic policies and provide valuable insights into the complexities of market economies. Smith's interdisciplinary approach merging philosophy, economics, and political theory remains highly influential, making his work essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the foundations of modern economics.\n",

      "Constantine I (27 February c. 272 – 22 May 337), also known as Constantine the Great, was a Roman emperor from AD 306 to 337 and the first emperor to convert to Christianity. Born in Naissus, Dacia Mediterranea (now Niš, Serbia), he was the son of Flavius Constantius, a Roman army officer of Illyrian origin who had been one of the four rulers of the Tetrarchy. His mother, Helena, was a Greek woman of low birth and a Christian. Later canonised as a saint, she is traditionally credited for the conversion of her son. Constantine served with distinction under the Roman emperors Diocletian and Galerius. He began his career by campaigning in the eastern provinces (against the Persians) before being recalled in the west (in AD 305) to fight alongside his father in the province of Britannia. After his father's death in 306, Constantine was acclaimed as augustus (emperor) by his army at Eboracum (York, England). He eventually emerged victorious in the civil wars against emperors Maxentius and Licinius to become the sole ruler of the Roman Empire by 324.\n",
      "Upon his ascension, Constantine enacted numerous reforms to strengthen the empire. He restructured the government, separating civil and military authorities. To combat inflation, he introduced the solidus, a new gold coin that became the standard for Byzantine and European currencies for more than a thousand years. The Roman army was reorganised to consist of mobile units (comitatenses), often around the Emperor, to serve on campaigns against external enemies or Roman rebels, and frontier-garrison troops (limitanei) which were capable of countering barbarian raids, but less and less capable, over time, of countering full-scale barbarian invasions. Constantine pursued successful campaigns against the tribes on the Roman frontiers—such as the Franks, the Alemanni, the Goths, and the Sarmatians—and resettled territories abandoned by his predecessors during the Crisis of the Third Century with citizens of Roman culture.\n",
      "Although Constantine lived much of his life as a pagan and later as a catechumen, he began to favour Christianity beginning in 312, finally becoming a Christian and being baptised by Eusebius of Nicomedia, an Arian bishop, although the Catholic Church and the Coptic Orthodox Church maintain that he was baptised by Pope Sylvester I. He played an influential role in the proclamation of the Edict of Milan in 313, which declared tolerance for Christianity in the Roman Empire. He convoked the First Council of Nicaea in 325 which produced the statement of Christian belief known as the Nicene Creed. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built on his orders at the purported site of Jesus' tomb in Jerusalem and was deemed the holiest place in all of Christendom. The papal claim to temporal power in the High Middle Ages was based on the fabricated Donation of Constantine. He has historically been referred to as the \"First Christian Emperor,\" but while he did favour the Christian Church, some modern scholars debate his beliefs and even his comprehension of Christianity. Nevertheless, he is venerated as a saint in Eastern Christianity, and he did much to push Christianity towards the mainstream of Roman culture.\n",

      "Juego del palo or banot (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈxweɣo ðel ˈpalo], game of the stick; Guanche: banod) is a traditional martial art/folk sport of stick-fighting practiced in the Canary Islands. It involves the combative use of a slender stick from 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) long, wielded in both hands, and characterised by fluid motion in attacks and defences.\n",
      "Though similar stick fighting techniques are present in the Iberian peninsula (e.g. Portuguese and Galician jogo do pau), the origins of juego del palo may be traced back to the Guanches, the indigenous people of the Canary Islands in pre-colonial times during the early 15th century. A Spanish engineer named Leonardo Torriani wrote a history of the Canary Islands in 1590 and included a record of early juego del palo, accompanied by an illustration of two Guanche warriors performing a type of ritual combat with short staves in a small arena. Torriani wrote;\n",
      "\"When two Canarians went to duel, they met at a special place established for this purpose. It was a small enclosure with a level, raised stone platform at each end. To begin, they each stood upon a platform, armed with three of the smooth throwing stones they call tahuas, and also with the stick called magodo or amodeghe. Then they dodged the stones as they were thrown, skillfully twisting their bodies without moving their feet. Next, they stepped down and fenced with the staves, each one trying to gain advantage over the other, as is our custom also.\"\n",
      "The art has been maintained through to the present day, undergoing a particular renaissance during the 1970s as part of a general effort to maintain native Canarian folk traditions. It bears resemblance to the Portuguese martial art jogo do pau and the Venezuelan form juego del garrote.\n",
      "Juego del palo is now a popular sports activity in the Canaries and has been the subject of considerable academic interest as well, with a number of professional conferences having been held at local universities to investigate the history, culture, and technique of the art.\n",
      "This may be described as a form of stick fencing between two players that is characterized by the spontaneous interplay of attacking techniques and defense techniques. No protective equipment is worn in traditional juego del palo; safety is maintained through the skilled control of attacks, which are restrained rather than being made with full force upon the opponent's body.\n",
      "Juego del palo is divided into a number of specific styles or local traditions that have been developed on particular islands within the archipelago, and/or by particular families. The nine primary styles practiced in modern juego del palo include (mostly named after founders of the styles): Deniz, Morales, Verga, Acosta, Quintero, Vidal, Confiero, juego del garrote ('game of the club') and juego de la lata ('game of the tin') . Each style is distinguished from the others by specific fighting techniques and strategies, and also by the rules under which it is played as a competitive game.\n",

      "Book of Thoth is a name given to many ancient Egyptian texts supposed to have been written by Thoth, the Egyptian god of writing and knowledge. They include many texts that were claimed to exist by ancient authors and a magical book that appears in an Egyptian work of fiction.\n",
      "The Egyptians stored many texts, on a wide range of subjects, in \"Houses of Life\", the libraries contained within temple complexes. As Thoth was the god of knowledge, many of these texts were claimed to be his work. The Egyptian historian Manetho said that Thoth wrote 36,525 books.The church father Clement of Alexandria, in the sixth book of his work Stromata, mentions forty-two books used by Egyptian priests that he says contain \"the whole philosophy of the Egyptians\". All these books, according to Clement, were written by Hermes (a pre-existing Greek god that the Greeks likened to Thoth, claiming they were the same god, having similar qualities, e.g. both invented writing). Translation from Egyptian language and concepts to Greek language and concepts was not entirely accurate, and some Egyptian authenticity was lost. Among the subjects they cover are hymns, rituals, temple construction, astrology, geography, and medicine.The Egyptologists Richard Lewis Jasnow and Karl-Theodor Zauzich have dubbed a long Egyptian text from the Ptolemaic period \"the Book of Thoth\". This Demotic text, known from more than forty fragmentary copies, consists of a dialogue between a person called \"The-one-who-loves-knowledge\" and a figure that Jasnow and Zauzich identify as Thoth. The topics of their conversation include the work of scribes, various aspects of the gods and their sacred animals, and the Duat, the realm of the dead.\n",
      "The fictional Book of Thoth appears in an ancient Egyptian short story from the Ptolemaic period, known as \"Setne Khamwas and Naneferkaptah\" or \"Setne I\". The book, written by Thoth, contains two spells, one of which allows the reader to understand the speech of animals, and one which allows the reader to perceive the gods themselves.According to the story, the book was originally hidden at the bottom of the Nile near Coptos, where it was locked inside a series of boxes guarded by serpents. The Egyptian prince Neferkaptah fought the serpents and retrieved the book, but in punishment for his theft from Thoth, the gods killed his wife Ahwere and son Merab. Neferkaptah committed suicide and was entombed along with the book. Generations later, the story's protagonist, Setne Khamwas (a character based on the historical prince Khaemwaset), steals the book from Neferkaptah's tomb despite opposition from Neferkaptah's ghost. Setne then meets a beautiful woman who seduces him into killing his children and humiliating himself in front of the pharaoh. He discovers that this episode was an illusion created by Neferkaptah, and in fear of further retribution, Setne returns the book to Neferkaptah's tomb. At Neferkaptah's request, Setne also finds the bodies of Neferkaptah's wife and son and buries them in Neferkaptah's tomb, which is then sealed.The story reflects the Egyptian belief that the gods' knowledge is not meant for humans to possess.\n",
      "The Book of Thoth is often featured in fiction with Egyptian or supernatural themes. Novels that do so include Brood of the Witch-Queen (1918) by Sax Rohmer; Moses, Man of the Mountain (1938) by Zora Neale Hurston; Mumbo Jumbo (1972) by Ishmael Reed; The Rosetta Key (2008) by William Dietrich; and The Serpent's Shadow (2012) by Rick Riordan. The Book plays a role in Henry H. Neff's juvenile fantasy series The Tapestry, Lisa Maxwell's young adult series The Last Magician, and Lynne Ewing's young adult series Sisters of Isis.\n",

       "'In mathematics, homogeneous coordinates or projective coordinates, introduced by August Ferdinand Möbius in his 1827 work Der barycentrische Calcul, are a system of coordinates used in projective geometry, just as Cartesian coordinates are used in Euclidean geometry. They have the advantage that the coordinates of points, including points at infinity, can be represented using finite coordinates. Formulas involving homogeneous coordinates are often simpler and more symmetric than their Cartesian counterparts. Homogeneous coordinates have a range of applications, including computer graphics and 3D computer vision, where they allow affine transformations and, in general, projective transformations to be easily represented by a matrix. They are also used in fundamental elliptic curve cryptography algorithms.If homogeneous coordinates of a point are multiplied by a non-zero scalar then the resulting coordinates represent the same point. Since homogeneous coordinates are also given to points at infinity, the number of coordinates required to allow this extension is one more than the dimension of the projective space being considered. For example, two homogeneous coordinates are required to specify a point on the projective line and three homogeneous coordinates are required to specify a point in the projective plane.\\nThe real projective plane can be thought of as the Euclidean plane with additional points added, which are called points at infinity, and are considered to lie on a new line, the line at infinity. There is a point at infinity corresponding to each direction (numerically given by the slope of a line), informally defined as the limit of a point that moves in that direction away from the origin. Parallel lines in the Euclidean plane are said to intersect at a point at infinity corresponding to their common direction. Given a point (x, y) on the Euclidean plane, for any non-zero real number Z, the triple (xZ, yZ, Z) is called a set of homogeneous coordinates for the point. By this definition, multiplying the three homogeneous coordinates by a common, non-zero factor gives a new set of homogeneous coordinates for the same point. In particular, (x, y, 1) is such a system of homogeneous coordinates for the point (x, y).\\nFor example, the Cartesian point (1, 2) can be represented in homogeneous coordinates as (1, 2, 1) or (2, 4, 2). The original Cartesian coordinates are recovered by dividing the first two positions by the third. Thus unlike Cartesian coordinates, a single point can be represented by infinitely many homogeneous coordinates.\\nThe equation of a line through the origin (0, 0) may be written nx + my = 0 where n and m are not both 0. In parametric form this can be written x = mt, y = −nt. Let Z = 1/t, so the coordinates of a point on the line may be written (m/Z,  −n/Z). In homogeneous coordinates this becomes (m,  −n, Z). In the limit, as t approaches infinity, in other words, as the point moves away from the origin, Z approaches 0 and the homogeneous coordinates of the point become (m, −n, 0). Thus we define (m, −n, 0) as the homogeneous coordinates of the point at infinity corresponding to the direction of the line nx + my = 0. As any line of the Euclidean plane is parallel to a line passing through the origin, and since parallel lines have the same point at infinity, the infinite point on every line of the Euclidean plane has been given homogeneous coordinates.\\nTo summarize:'"

During this process it is essential to avoid data leaking. We will have to ensure that the different subsets of the data do not overlap. With the IMDB reviews, each review is independent, so we can simply perform a random split. However, with the AI-generated reviews, there are ten reviews for each movie, and we will avoid having the same movie appear in different subsets. The reddit posts are also independent, but we will keep the AI-generated and human reddit posts with the same title in the same subset. We also note that the wikipedia articles are not entirely independent. In the data, each article is linked to the one before and after it, so there is some overlap in content to be expected. We will divide the dataset in the way it was organised originally, which ensures that articles that are closely related do not frequently occur across the different splits."
