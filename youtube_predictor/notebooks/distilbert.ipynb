        "In the previous notebook we used tfidf-vectorisation combined with classical ML methods to classify YouTube videos based on views. Now we can explore another approach: a pre-trained LLM. For this task we'll be using distilBERT, a compact version of Google's BERT model. We will combine four text features -- the video category, the channel title, the video title and the video description -- as the input to the model.  Let's import the training data and fill NA values with empty strings."

This is a feature-length documentary based on their viral short film entitled 'Down To Earth,' that reveals the scientific phenomenon of how we can heal our bodies by doing the simplest thing that a person can do\\u2026standing barefoot on the earth. \\n\\nThe winner of the Audience Award for Best Documentary at Dances With Films Festival, the film shares the Tickell family's journey with the healing power of grounding, aka earthing, and the people they met and learned from along the way; featuring grounding pioneer Clint Ober, author Deepak Chopra M.D., actress/activist Amy Smart, author/activist Mariel Hemingway, cardiologist Dr. Stephen Sinatra, renowned healer Dr Joseph Mercola, engineer and physicist Gaetan Chevalier, PhD. and many others. \\n\\nOver 20 peer-reviewed studies have shown that Grounding (Earthing) reduces inflammation...one of the most damaging internal biological processes that leads to chronic disease. So get out there and put your feet on the ground, and/or increase your grounding time indoors with grounding products. Your body and mind will thank you!
